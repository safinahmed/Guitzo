======

Part of the backend of a C# application similar to Mint.com for Portugal

This code includes a crawler that would gather all companies and their business type from a local business directory
Another crawler to gather the deals from a local deal-of-the-day (Groupon, etc) aggregator
Several parses that could parse the Bank Statements exported from several banks in Portugal (BCP, CGD, BES, Montepio, among others)
A Prediction engine using Naive Bayes algorithm that would predict what type of expenditure each line of the Bank Statements pertains to

The Naive Bayes algorithm was based on an already developed class found online
